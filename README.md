Hotel Revenue Analysis: A Data-Driven Analysis with PowerBI
.
Problem Statement- 
AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. 
Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, 
AtliQ Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. 
.
For this analysis three months data are given - May, June and July. Let’s dive into the key findings from our PowerBI dashboard.

Key points to remember- 
1.In hospitality sector Weekday starts from Sunday to Thursday, Friday and Saturday are considered Weekend.
2.Total available rooms- if a hotel has 100 rooms, 5 rooms are out of order then available rooms are 95. 
3. RevPAR- Revenue per available room  - Total Revenue / Total rooms available to sell. 
4. ADR –Average Daily Rate- The average rate the rooms are sold.
5. Occupancy % = Total rooms occupied / Total rooms available.
• If occupancy is 100% then ADR and RevPAR will be equal. Depending upon the available rooms all the calculation will vary. For daily available room DSRN is considered.
6.DSRN - Daily sellable room nights.
7.URN- Utilised Room Nights – if you have a100 room hotel, with 100 available rooms and if 50 rooms are booked and stayed by customers, then URN is 50.
• DURN - Daily Utilized Room Nights.
8.BRN- Booked Room Nights – if 60 customers made booking and 10 end ends up not staying due to cancellation or no show, then 50 customers stayed and 50 is BRN.
• DBRN - Daily Booked Room Nights
• URN = BRN + No show + Cancellation
• Realisation – URN/BRN
