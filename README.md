Problem Statement- 
AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. 
Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, 
AtliQ Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. 
.
For this analysis three months data are given - May, June and July. Let’s dive into the key findings from our PowerBI dashboard.

**Key points to remember**- 
1.In hospitality sector Weekday starts from Sunday to Thursday, Friday and Saturday are considered Weekend.
2.Total available rooms- if a hotel has 100 rooms, 5 rooms are out of order then available rooms are 95. 
3. RevPAR- Revenue per available room  - Total Revenue / Total rooms available to sell. 
4. ADR –Average Daily Rate- The average rate the rooms are sold.
5. Occupancy % = Total rooms occupied / Total rooms available.
• If occupancy is 100% then ADR and RevPAR will be equal. Depending upon the available rooms all the calculation will vary. For daily available room DSRN is considered.
6.DSRN - Daily sellable room nights.
7.URN- Utilised Room Nights – if you have a100 room hotel, with 100 available rooms and if 50 rooms are booked and stayed by customers, then URN is 50.
• DURN - Daily Utilized Room Nights.
8.BRN- Booked Room Nights – if 60 customers made booking and 10 end ends up not staying due to cancellation or no show, then 50 customers stayed and 50 is BRN.
• DBRN - Daily Booked Room Nights
• URN = BRN + No show + Cancellation
• Realisation – URN/BRN

3.**City & Property-Wise Breakdown** - 
•	Top performing property: Atliq Exotica Mumbai with ₹212M revenue and highest successful bookings.
•	City trends:
(i) Delhi has the highest average rating (3.78).
(ii)	Bangalore has a strong presence in both revenue and bookings.
(iii) Mumbai dominates in revenue.

4.Recommendations:-

(i) Change pricing strategy: From the weekly trend it is evident that occupancy is fluctuating week on week basis,
however rates are not fluctuating at all. As May, June , July are summer holidays, people travel more in this season,
it is expected that rates will fluctuate , but from the weekly trend it can be seen that **ADR is flatline**.
Therefore it is evident that the hotels do not have any dynamic pricing strategy, probably they are selling at flat rate pricing.
They can adapt pricing to dynamic pricing or weekday/weekend pricing for the Leisure hotels.

(ii) Focus on Bottom-performing Properties: From the report it can been seen that Atliq Grands Bangalore has least occupancy at 44.40% with rating 2.36.
Also there is not much diffrence between ADR in Weekday and Weekend. Therefore the bottom-performing hotels are an opportunity for improvement.
They can use Atliq Exotica Mumbai as a benchmark — analyse what’s driving its performance and replicate successful tactics in other locations 
i.e staff quality, amenities, rating, pricing strategy. Generally, in hotel industry when pricing drops the occupancy increases.
Also the rating is on the lowest side which indicates the these hotels are not looking at the ratings and reviews given by the customers.
•	Delhi leads in average rating — it can be analyzed what guests love here (cleanliness? staff service?) and standardize those practices across all locations.

(iii) Leverage Platform Performance : The management can consider channel optimization to reduce dependency on intermediaries like “others” 
and negotiate better margins or promote better-converting platforms like “logtrip” by investing in SEO, paid ads, loyalty programs
to improve these channels.
•	They can also update their own online platform and introduce exclusive direct booking discount coupons while online booking check-out 
or add any complementary value-added-service to improve rating and reviews.
•	Promotions of own channel using bundling offers, corporate tie-ups or discounted upgrades for weekdays can boost occupancy.
